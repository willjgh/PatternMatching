PatternMatching allows the creation of programs: sequences of nodes containing rules that act on a grid. Rules are the main idea of the program, they contain an input and output pattern (1D or 2D) for which matches in a 2D grid of colours are found and replaced. Nodes allow rules to be applied in different orders, and rules themselves have many options that can affect their application. All this allows a variety of programs from chess movements and random spreads to the creation of flowers and river landscapes.
